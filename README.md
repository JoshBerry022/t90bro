# t90bro bot
A fun project to create a twitch bot that acts on t90bro's behalf in [T90Official](https://www.twitch.tv/t90official)'s channel.

#### Ideas
```
[ ] basic responses to... t90salute, etc?
[ ] t90facts: randomly be able to recite them
[ ] t90admin: answer questions about his schedule, rules, etc
[ ] stories: randomly be able to tell a short story about t90
[ ] general jokes
[ ] knock knock jokes directed at a person (this requires context!)
[ ] chat logging into a file that gets offloaded into s3 periodically
  [ ] this logging should try to avoid votes (how?)
[ ] report on stats that the bot observes - most talkative fan, most common words, etc
[ ] recipes: have t90 sanctioned recipes 
  [ ] allow for open ended suggestions - are you in the mood for... etc (context!)
[ ] after enough data is gathered, true AI outbursts
[ ] can twitch bot log stats? so line charts of chat or visitors?
[ ] Games!
  [ ] somethig that starts with a letter ... is it blue? is it a noun? etc
[ ] memes!
  [ ] meme facts
[ ] weather
[ ] rigged detector: vote count, if final vote is close report on multivotes or people who voted weird
[ ]age wikipedia: answer tons of knowlede about aoe
  [ ] units & stats
  [ ] counters
  [ ] build orders
[ ] cleverbot mode: just be a middleman for cleverbot
```
